Legislative/Federal Politics/Gun Issues Committee

Please contact your Connecticut Representative and Senator to:

**Oppose H.B. 7259:** which would require permit, certificate or license reciprocity between Connecticut and other states that have substantially similar standards for carrying a pistol or revolver

**Support H.B. 6200:** which would require individuals who carrying a pistol or revolver to produce their permit upon request of a law enforcement officer if the firearm is visible to such officer.

**Oppose H.B. No. 6546** regarding adding a pipeline tax for natural gas on all CT residents

If you don't know who your state rep/sen is, or how to get in touch with them, just text 520-200-2223 and text your zip code, and wait for response!
Thanks!

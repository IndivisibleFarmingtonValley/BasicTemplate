# "Farmington Valley Victory" phonebank
 April 29th at 81 Canton Rd., West Simsbury.  It will start at 6:00, but come any time after that!  Please bring your cell phone and lap top.  We have two extra computers for those of you who do not have a lap top.  We will help you from there! A southern dinner will be provided; pulled pork, beans, and slaw in keeping with the GA/South Carolina theme!  We need to win these races! 
Please let me know if you can make it, so I can have enough food and stations for phone banking! 
RSVP to Rene' at bradfordba@aol.com.

Please contact your Connecticut Representative and Senator to:

**Support H.B. 6200:** which would require individuals who carrying a pistol or revolver to produce their permit upon request of a law enforcement officer if the firearm is visible to such officer.

**Oppose H.B. No. 6546** regarding adding a pipeline tax for natural gas on all CT residents

If you don't know who your state rep/sen is, or how to get in touch with them, just text 520-200-2223 and text your zip code, and wait for response!

# **Al Gore’s CLIMATE REALITY 101 PRESENTATION**
##  June 13, 6:30 at the Farmington Library  
Please come and support the environmental committee and see how CT is affected by global warming and what we are doing to combat it here in CT. Please RSVP to farmingtonlibraries.org or call 860-673-6791. This is about our future and our kids’ futures!

# **SPECIAL ELECTION PHONE BANKING! **
## June 14, 6:00-9:0081 Canton Rd. West Simsbury 
Support Democratic Insurgent Candidates in Georgia (Jon Ossoff) and South Carolina (Archie Parnell)!  Dinner will be served. Bring your cell phone and laptop.
Did you know 1 out of every 5 republicans in Ossoff’s area voted for him in the primary.  It is a stretch, but he can win with our help! Parnell’s area 8 years ago was blue. We can do this!

# "Indivisible March in Honor of the 19th" ****
 August 26th all Indivisible Groups will march in support of the 19th amendment that allowed women to vote. Our local march is at:

 **Connecticut Legislative Office Building 300 Capitol Avenue, Hartford, CT, Hartford, CT,
** 

We hope you can join us for the first Indivisible National March!

SPECIAL ELECTION PHONE BANKING**
 81 Canton Rd. West Simsbury 
Support Democratic Insurgent Candidates in Georgia (Jon Ossoff) and South Carolina (Archie Parnell)!  Dinner will be served. Bring your cell phone and laptop.
Did you know 1 out of every 5 republicans in Ossoff’s area voted for him in the primary.  It is a stretch, but he can win with our help! Parnell’s area 8 years ago was blue. We can do this!
